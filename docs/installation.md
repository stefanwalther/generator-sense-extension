**Prerequisites:**

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) installed globally (`npm install yeoman -g`)
- (Ideally you have a GitHub account)

**Installation of _Yeoman Generator for Qlik Sense Visualization Extensions_:**

```bash
npm install generator-sense-extension -g
```
(It is recommended to install the generator globally (**`-g`**), then you can easily use it for multiple projects)

**Run sense-extension generator**

Create a directory and switch to it

```
mkdir my-new-extension
cd my-new extension
```
Then run the generator:
```bash 
yo sense-extension
```

Follow the question in the command line, then your are done!
