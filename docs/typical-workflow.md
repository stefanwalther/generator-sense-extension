1. Think of a good name for your visualization extension (e.g. "astonishing-chart")
2. Create a GitHub repository using that name (this will result into https://github.com/YOURNAME/astonishing-chart)
3. Install Yeoman generator globally, if you haven't done this before (`npm install yeoman -g`)
4. Install the **Yeoman Generator for Sense Visualization Extensions** globally (`npm install generator-sense-extension -g`)
5. Create a directory for your visualization extension (e.g. `mkdir c:\my-extensions\astonishing-chart`)
6. Then switch to the created directory (`cd C:\my-extensions\astonishing-chart`)
5. Run Yeoman generator `sense-extension` (`yo sense-extension`)
6. Follow the prompts

Then you are done, a basic structure for your visualization extension is created.
